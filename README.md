This was the midterm given in class in my Data Structures and Algorithms course. 
This program simulates a fruit vendor in a marketplace where people can buy or sell the 
three different types of fruit. A queue is used to store and process requests and if the
vendor doesn't have enough fruit for a customer, the are placed in another queue and
need to wait for someone to come and sell more fruit to the vendor.

We were given ~3 hours to complete it. There are no comments because of the time constraint.
